Create a Route for Personalized Greetings
Define a page route that accepts a name as a parameter. For example, the
route could be "/greeting/:name".
When a user accesses this route with a specific name (e.g.,
"/greeting/Alice"), your nuxt app should dynamically generate a
personalized greeting message for that user.
Design a home page (/) for your application.
Prompt the user to enter their name
the user's name should be passed as a parameter to the "/greeting/:name"
route.
Happy Coding!
